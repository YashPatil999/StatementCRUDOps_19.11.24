CRUD Operations Using Prepared Statements in Java

Features:

Insert Data: Add a new record with details (ID, Name, Address) into the database.
Update Data: Modify the Name and Address of an existing record using the ID.
Delete Data: Remove a record from the database by its ID.
Retrieve Data: Fetch and display all records from the personDetails table.
